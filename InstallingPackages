This text document holds the commands needed to install the required packages
for the voice assistant API.

First, Try to run the shell script. This should attempt to install
every dependency automatically. In your terminal, navigate to the script and
run
	
	chmod u+x Dependencies.sh
	./Dependencies.sh

If everything works, you should be able to run the test script
"TestDependencies.py" without any issues.

To install everything manually, run the following commands

1)pip install speech_recognition
2)pip install gtts
3)sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
4)pip install playsound

Once done, try running the python program: TestPackages.py
If it runs and outputs an error about a missing package,
try installing that package again. If you have trouble post
to slack!

The output should be:
	"Successfully loaded all dependencies."
